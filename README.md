## Basic usecase schematics

## Necessary preconditions
  - TODO configuration description

## Source idea
The implementation is heavily inspired by [Enceladus](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/enceladus) that already contained 
a similar single purpose login functionality with JWT. Also, Tomcat@SBT implementation is on the other hand drawn from 
[atum-service](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/atum-service).


## Current development state
Currently, only a skeleton of the project exists. The project uses `xsbt-web-plugin` plugin, therefore to get
the service running (also builds the service `war`), one can run:

```sbt
sbt
service / Tomcat / start
```
